\cvsection{Summary}

A Machine Learning Engineer and a Researcher with 2+ years of experience in applied machine learning research and cloud-native application development. Background in computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), development and deployment of production-grade applications. Currently working towards a Ph.D. in Bioengineering to contribute to the advancement of Healthcare with the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI). As a lifelong learner and AI enthusiast, I have guided university students on various occasions with one-to-one meetings, webinars and Medium articles. Looking to utilise my skills and grow in a stimulating and collaborative environment at the University of Auckland as a Graduate Teaching Assistant.
