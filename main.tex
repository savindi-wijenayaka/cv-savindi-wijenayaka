\cvevent{Machine Learning Engineer}{\href{http://www.wso2.com}{WSO2} $\cdot$ Full-time}{Sept 2020 - Nov 2021}{Colombo, Sri Lanka} 
WSO2 is one of the world's leading open-source integration vendors. Choreo is its latest product, providing an AI-enhanced integrated platform as a service.
\medskip
\begin{itemize} 
    
    \item Researched and developed a GPT-based deep learning model, using Python, Flask, and Keras, deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service, for automating test case generation for the APIs developed by customers in Choreo, resulting in a reduction of the customers' manual effort.
    
    \item Co-architected and implemented Choreo’s AI Anomaly Detection system using Azure Stream Analytics, Event Hubs, T-SQL, and Function Apps, integrating microservices via event-driven architecture for secure, scalable cloud deployment, enabling customers to detect abnormal application behaviours early on.
    
    \item Implemented regression tests for detecting performance degradations and resource utilization issues in the Ballerina Language Server in the Choreo Editor, using Python, JMeter, Azure Log Analytics Workspace, and Azure DevOps pipelines, ensuring consistent performance and reliability for users.
    
    \item Diagnosed and resolved a critical memory leak in the Ballerina Language Server using JMeter and Eclipse Memory Analyser, which prevented server crashes and improved resource efficiency in the Choreo Editor.
\end{itemize}

\cvevent{Software Research Engineer}{\href{https://www.pearson.com/}{Pearson} $\cdot$ Internship}{Sept 2018 - Sept 2019}{Colombo, Sri Lanka}   % chktex 8
Pearson is a leading Education provider, offering curriculum materials, multimedia learning tools, and testing programs to help educate people worldwide.
\medskip
\begin{itemize}
    \item Researched and implemented deep learning modules for emotion detection and speech analysis in the AI-based Public Speaking Evaluator Service, using Keras, Kaldi, and OpenCV. Integrated models into RESTful services (Flask, later Django) and automated deployment via Ansible for scalable real-time evaluation.

    \item Examined Question Answering and Machine Comprehension to build a Q\&A chatbot service for Pearson’s educational content, using AllenNLP and BiDAF, later extending it with fine-tuned BERT and GPT-2 models, exposing the service via a Django REST API and automated deployment using Ansible.

    \item Investigated and developed a flashcard classification service using ULMFiT, LSTM, and GRU to automatically categorise flashcards created by students or the system, deployed via Django REST framework.

    % \item Evaluated and tested NoSQL and relational database migration strategies (MongoDB, MSSQL, MySQL) and conducted performance testing on ScaleOut State Servers within AWS EC2 environments.

\end{itemize}

\cvsection{Education}

\cvevent{Ph.D. in Bioengineering}{University of Auckland}{Dec 2021 - May 2025}{Auckland, New Zealand}   
A deep learning centred computational framework was developed for automated 3D gastric microstructure analysis, integrating dataset curation, ground truth labelling, semantic segmentation, and downstream 3D computational quantification to enable scalable, reproducible anatomical assessment and modelling.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Engineered a semantic segmentation model integrating multiscale channel and spatial attention mechanisms; conducted extensive ablation studies to optimize architecture, resulting in an automated pipeline that reduced manual analysis time by over 40 hours per dataset.
    \item Developed a robust Python-based 3D quantification framework and data pipeline, transforming raw micro-CT data into structured geometric benchmarks; standardised the workflow from ground-truth labelling to downstream in-silico modelling across 20+ experimental samples.
