\cvsection{Experience}

\cvevent{Machine Learning Engineer}{\href{http://www.wso2.com}{WSO2} $\cdot$ Full-time}{Sept 2020 - Nov 2021}{Colombo, Sri Lanka} 
WSO2 is one of the world's leading open-source integration vendors. Choreo is its latest product, providing an AI-enhanced integrated platform as a service.
\medskip
\begin{itemize} 
    \item Researched, engineered and deployed the initial phase of Choreo's AI-assisted testing feature, using Python, Keras, Flask, Kubernetes and Azure DevOps pipelines.
    \item Architected, developed and deployed Choreo’s AI-based anomaly detector with two other engineers, using Azure solutions, Ballerina, and Python, while adhering to security best practices, scaling requirements, and optimised resource usage.
    \item Diagnosed and resolved a critical memory leak in the Ballerina Language Server using JMeter and Eclipse Memory Analyser (MAT), which helped in the optimisation of resources in Choreo.
    \item Contributed to automating the performance testing of Choreo by creating a library and a pipeline for system metrics collection using Python, Kusto Query Language (KQL), Seaborn, and Azure DevOps pipelines.

\cvsection{Education}

\cvevent{Ph.D. in Bioengineering \small{(under examination)}}{University of Auckland}{Dec 2021 - May 2025}{Auckland, New Zealand}   
\begin{itemize}
    \item Analysed gastric microstructures using an interdisciplinary approach integrating micro-CT imaging, mathematics, computational anatomy, and deep learning, advancing the understanding of healthy stomachs.
    \item Engineered a semantic segmentation model to distinguish gastric tissue layers, integrating multiscale channel and spatial attention concepts, implementing numerous ablation studies, and saving over 40 hours per dataset.
    \item Developed a robust three-dimensional gastric tissue quantification framework using advanced mathematical techniques in Python; delivered precise measurements from 20+ tissue samples, establishing the first benchmark for future research.
    \item Developed a comprehensive computational model compiling crucial geometric information alongside quantification details sourced from 8 distinct experiments, enabling future in-silico experiments.
    \item Conducted biological experiments to collect and prepare rodent stomachs for micro CT imaging, resulting in a streamlined process that enhanced sample quality and consistency across 15 experimental trials.
